# FutureMove
Ever had to move to a new city? It's can be a very stressful event to learn all about the new place you are moving to- whether it be where your new favorite spot to hang out will be to the new school your children will be moving to. All in all, it can be a pretty tough time. That's where FutureMove comes to the rescue! 

FutureMove is a web-based application that allows users to search an area by zip code and find out what houses are being listed for sale in that area, what schools are nearby, the local hotspots and restaurants, and even information regarding crime rates in the area!
